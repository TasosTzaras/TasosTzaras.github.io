            <h2>Academic Thesis</h2>
            <h4>
                (Machine Learning in Drug Discovery)</h4>
            <h4>In my thesis on target identification in drug discovery using machine learning, I focused on identifying
                viable
                molecular targets specifically for COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes. These enzymes are crucial in inflammatory
                processes, making
                them primary targets for developing anti-inflammatory drugs. Traditional methods for identifying these
                targets are
                costly and time-consuming, so my research aimed to develop a data-driven machine learning approach to
                streamline this
                process.<br><br>
                Data Collection and Preparation<br>
                I curated a comprehensive dataset from sources like ChEMBL and the Protein Data Bank (PDB), which
                included molecular
                descriptors, structural information, and known interactions between COX enzymes and various compounds.
                Key features
                included hydrophobicity, molecular weight, topological polar surface area, and sequence-based
                descriptors, providing
                essential data points for predictive modeling.<br>
                To prepare the data for analysis, I addressed class imbalance with SMOTE (Synthetic Minority
                Over-sampling Technique) to
                balance interactions versus non-interactions. I also applied standardization and normalization
                techniques to ensure
                consistency across the dataset and reduce noise.<br>
                Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
                Through EDA, I explored correlations among descriptors, refining highly correlated features like
                molecular weight and
                surface area to avoid redundancy. Visualizing descriptor distributions allowed me to observe trends
                specific to COX-1
                and COX-2 interactions, guiding feature selection and engineering to capture biologically relevant
                patterns.<br><br>
                Model Evaluation<br>
                Model evaluation was conducted using the following metrics:<br>
                Precision
                Recall
                F1 Score
                ROC-AUC
                Interpretability and Feature Importance
                To ensure interpretability, I used SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values, which helped pinpoint
                the molecular
                descriptors most influential in identifying COX-1 and COX-2 interactions. Important features like
                hydrophobicity and
                polarity consistently aligned with known biological insights into COX binding, supporting the relevance
                of the model’s
                predictions.<br><br>
                Results and Conclusions<br>
                After fine-tuning, my models demonstrated high precision in predicting COX-1 and COX-2 targets,
                significantly reducing
                the need for exhaustive experimental testing. This work underscored the potential for machine learning
                to efficiently
                identify therapeutic targets, advancing drug discovery efforts for COX-specific treatments.

            <h2>Internship</h2>
            <h4>
                (Machine Learning Engineer @ EdenLibrary)</h4>
            <h4>During my internship, I focused on advanced computer vision tasks, honing my skills in both
                model
                experimentation and
                dataset management. I began by working with YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 models, initially testing YOLOv5’s
                performance on large
                vehicle datasets under various conditions like low light and nighttime, which helped me identify
                key
                model limitations.
                This led to the use of CVAT for manual annotation and dataset refinement, ensuring better
                training data
                for challenging
                environments. Through detailed experimentation, I compared the performance of different dataset
                sizes,
                gaining insights
                into how image quantity affects model accuracy.<br><br>
                To address domain adaptation challenges, I implemented Style Transfer using the StyleShot tool,
                successfully changing
                images’ lighting conditions to evaluate model robustness across diverse settings. This
                adaptation
                allowed me to train
                and test models using images taken at different times of the day, with notable results recorded
                on
                TensorBoard. I also
                explored PhyCV for physics-based image processing, which enhanced image quality by removing
                excess light
                or shadows,
                providing cleaner inputs for training.<br><br>
                On the research side, I delved into domain generalization, transfer learning, and style transfer
                techniques, evaluating
                Visual-Language Models (VLMs) like Kosmos-2 and Florence-2 for potential in accelerating the
                annotation
                process. I
                further experimented with SAM2 on Ultralytics, exploring its segmentation and detection
                capabilities
                through bounding
                box prompts, enhancing the accuracy and speed of object detection.<br><br>
                Throughout the internship, I documented each phase and troubleshooting step, and I wrapped up by
                creating a
                comprehensive documentation of the entire workflow. This hands-on experience with machine
                learning tools
                and model
                fine-tuning broadened my expertise in deploying and optimizing computer vision systems across
                complex
                conditions.<br><br>
                Paris Amerikanos Machine Learning / Data Science / Physics<br>Paris managed Tasos directly.<br>
                "<i>I had the pleasure of mentoring Tasos during his 2-month internship at Eden Library, where he
                    worked as
                    a Machine
                    Learning Engineer.<br>
                    He quickly adapted to our projects and exceeded our expectations within the first week. Tasos

                    confident he’ll
                    excel in future roles. I highly recommend him for any opportunity in the field!</i>"
